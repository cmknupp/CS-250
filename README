How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User Stories are a simple way to put user needs into a standard format so they can be easily understood and managed on the Product Backlog.  Once the Prouct backlog
organized the developement team is able to work on items in a logical manner and complete the program incrementally.  

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach developing a program by looking for the main elements that will provide the backbone of the program and then work to add in functionality in a logical order
or in order of importance.  I really like the in open communication of the Agile/Scrum processes and I hope to work on a team that can succesfully maintain that kind of 
communication.  

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
It means that you work hard to achieve the team's goals and also work to support your team members in their work.  Open and honest communication is vital to the success
of an Agile team.
